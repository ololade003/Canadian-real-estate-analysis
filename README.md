PowerBI-RealEstate-Dashboard

Overview

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard and its corresponding wireframe designed for analyzing real estate data. The dashboard provides insights into property prices, distribution, and features, with a focus on property types such as Condo, Single Family, Duplex, and Townhome. The wireframe, created in PowerPoint, outlines the visual layout and user interface.

Features
Dashboard: A two-page Power BI report (.pbix) with:

Page 1: Market Overview with average prices by province and property type.

Page 2: Property Features analysis, including bedroom/bathroom counts and amenity impacts.

Interactive slicer for property type filtering.

Wireframe: A PowerPoint (.pptx) file visualizing the dashboard layout.
